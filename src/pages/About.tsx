          their assignments and projects, while many students aspire to become models but lack the connections to do so.

          This website makes it easy for both photographers and models to connect. Anyone with an rit.edu email can
          create a profile as a model, providing an opportunity to be seen and allowing photographers to use the site as
          a resource for discovering new faces.

              Jacob is a computer science student passionate about fashion, photography, and design. In 2021, he helped
              create <i>RIT Fabrick</i>, a fashion club that brings together students from different majors and
              backgrounds to share their love for fashion. Through his experiences leading the club, he saw a need for a
              platform to connect photographers and aspiring models, as there was no easy way for students to
              collaborate on these kinds of projects. By combining his skills in programming and design, he created{' '}
              <i>Models @ RIT</i>.
